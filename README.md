# JishoTangoAssistant

JishoTangoAssistant is an application which can create custom vocabulary lists for Japanese study purposes with the help of the [jisho.org API](https://jisho.org/forum/54fefc1f6e73340b1f160000-is-there-any-kind-of-search-api). These list can then be exported to Anki (via CSV files).

## Build
You can e.g. use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to build the application.

## Credits
Thanks to the team from [jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) for making this possible!
